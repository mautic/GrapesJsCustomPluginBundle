# GrapesJsCustomPluginBundle

## About the demo-plugin
This is a Mautic-Plugin to demonstrate how [3rd party](https://gjs.market/) or custom GrapesJS plugins can be added to Mautic's editor.

You can use this plugin as skeleton to start extending and customizing the GrapeJS editor for your needs.

## Usage
Basically any plugin bundle is able to add custom GrapesJS plugins using a global `window`-object for the registration.

Read how to do so in the official developer docs: [Creating a Plugin for GrapesJS](https://devdocs.mautic.org/en/5.x/themes/grapesjs.html#creating-a-plugin-for-grapesjs).
